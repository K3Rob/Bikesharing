[City Bikeshare Story](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kyle.robinson1292/viz/Bikesharing_16649470517920/CityBikeshare)

## Overview
Presentation of general trends in the use of a bike share program in New York City. Create a display showing the overall use and success in NYC.

## Results
Predominately trips are under an hour with the majority of them being less than 20 minutes. This allows bikes to stay in circulation so that people can continue to access them as they need.

Despite the disproportionate use of bikes by men in the under 20 minute category, women make use of bikes at a much closer rate when you look at the rides of an hour or longer.

Highest use times center mostly around the usual rush hours in the morning and evening. Weekends get a higher than usual use during typical work hours but Thursdays and Fridays have the highest use rates of any day of the week. Wednesday comes up as the lowest use of any day.

The use patterns hold true regardless of a users gender only emphasizing the difference in overall use between genders.

## Summary
The bike share program gets significant use within large cities and is great for areas where trips are typically under an hour. Some deaper research into the difference in use by men and women could help determine if the trend is due to marketing, placement, or other factors that have yet to be identified. Additional figures that could help would include checout times for usertype and a display of what days and times the longest trips occur.
